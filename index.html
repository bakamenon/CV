      Vijay moved to Japan from China last year (actually end of December 2018)
      to work for Nissan in the Yokohama Global Headquarters. Vijay works as a
      Senior Product Manager in the Sales systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vijay's parents are originally from Kannur, though he grew up in Aluva and
      Bangalore. He is an engineer by training and profession, but passionate
      about writing. He has a self published a book on Amazon with 5 five
      &#11088; ratings &#128541;, and the book is called
      <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Vijay-Menon-ebook/dp/B07DGTC8V1">
        Shanghai - A Year To Remember
      </a>
      . He also loves cooking, photography and long meandering walks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vijay moved to China back in 2008 for 6 months and then ended up staying
      for just over ten years. In 2015 he met Gina who would become his wife in
      2018, just before they left China. Gina is Chinese, who loves Onam and
      Vishu celebrations, and Bangalore as much as Vijay does. And yes...
      Vijay's wife is the guinea pig for his cooking experiments &#128516;.
